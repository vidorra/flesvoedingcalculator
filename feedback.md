# Accuracy Evaluation Feedback - Kennisbank Articles

## üîç **ACTUAL EVALUATION CONDUCTED**

What I **actually did**:
- Used an AI agent to analyze article files through the Task tool
- The agent provided detailed reports based on file content analysis
- Evaluated articles against stated criteria (medical accuracy, Dutch standards, safety)

What I **did NOT do**:
- Direct medical professional review
- Verification against actual RIVM/NVWA/Voedingscentrum 2024 guidelines
- Cross-reference with official Dutch health databases
- Independent fact-checking of medical claims
- Verification of pricing accuracy in Dutch market

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATIONS OF THIS EVALUATION**

### **AI Agent Analysis Limitations:**
1. **No real-time guideline verification** - Cannot access current official Dutch health websites
2. **No medical professional expertise** - AI assessment of medical accuracy has inherent limitations  
3. **No market price verification** - Cannot check current Dutch retail prices
4. **Pattern-based analysis** - May miss nuanced medical or cultural context
5. **No regulatory compliance verification** - Cannot verify actual NVWA/RIVM alignment

### **What This Evaluation Provides:**
- **Content consistency analysis** - Internal logic and structure review
- **General safety awareness assessment** - Basic safety principle evaluation
- **Writing quality review** - Clarity, completeness, organization
- **Obvious error identification** - Clear factual mistakes or contradictions

### **What's Still Needed for True Accuracy:**
- **Medical professional review** - Pediatrician or certified nutritionist evaluation
- **Official guideline verification** - Direct comparison with current RIVM/Voedingscentrum standards
- **Market research validation** - Current Dutch pricing and product availability
- **Parent user testing** - Practical usability and comprehension testing

## üìã **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS FOR REAL ACCURACY VERIFICATION**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Medical professional consultation** - Have pediatrician review health-critical articles
2. **Official guideline comparison** - Check current Dutch health authority websites
3. **Market price verification** - Research current Dutch formula/equipment costs
4. **Safety protocol verification** - Compare with current emergency response guidelines

### **Ongoing Quality Assurance:**
1. **Quarterly professional review** - Regular medical accuracy verification
2. **Guideline monitoring** - Track updates from Dutch health authorities
